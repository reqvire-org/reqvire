# Test: Element content extraction
# --------------------------------------
# Acceptance Criteria:
# - System should properly extract Requirement body for change impact detection
# - Requirement body consists of normalized main text and content from '#### Details' subsection
# - Details subsections should include the '#### Details' header in the extracted content
#
# Test Criteria:
# - Command exits with success (0) return code
# - Output shows expected content for each element including Details headers
