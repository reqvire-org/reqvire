## Auto-fixable Issues

### Safe Redundant Hierarchical Relations

**Element: Single-Chain Redundant Requirement**
File: [specifications/Requirements.md#single-chain-redundant-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#single-chain-redundant-requirement)

Safe redundant derivedFrom relations (these can be automatically removed):
  * derivedFrom: [specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement)

Reason: This element reaches 'specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement' through a single chain via 'specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement'. The direct relation to the ancestor is redundant and safe to remove.

### Redundant Verify Relations

**Verification: Test Verification**
File: [specifications/Verifications/Tests.md#test-verification](specifications/Verifications/Tests.md#test-verification)

Redundant verify relations (these can be automatically removed):
  * verify: [specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement)

Reason: This verification already verifies 'specifications/Requirements.md#leaf-requirement' which derives from 'specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement'. Verification traces automatically roll up through derivedFrom relations, so verifying the leaf requirement is sufficient.

## Needs Manual Review

### Maybe-Redundant Hierarchical Relations

**Element: Multi-Path Redundant Requirement**
File: [specifications/Requirements.md#multi-path-redundant-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#multi-path-redundant-requirement)

Potentially redundant derivedFrom relations detected:
  * derivedFrom: [specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement)

Reason: This element reaches 'specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement' through multiple paths (via 'specifications/Requirements.md#alternative-parent-requirement' and 'specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement'). Multiple paths may have semantic meaning. Manual review required to determine if the direct relation should be removed.
