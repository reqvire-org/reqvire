## Auto-fixable Issues

### Redundant Verify Relations

**Verification: Test Verification**
File: [specifications/Verifications/Tests.md#test-verification](specifications/Verifications/Tests.md#test-verification)

Redundant verify relations (these can be automatically removed):
  * verify: [specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement)

Reason: This verification already verifies 'specifications/Requirements.md#leaf-requirement' which derives from 'specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement'. Verification traces automatically roll up through derivedFrom relations, so verifying the leaf requirement is sufficient.

## Needs Manual Review

### Maybe-Redundant Hierarchical Relations

**Element: Maybe Redundant Requirement**
File: [specifications/Requirements.md#maybe-redundant-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#maybe-redundant-requirement)

Potentially redundant derivedFrom relations detected:
  * derivedFrom: [specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement)

Reason: This element has derivedFrom to both 'specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement' and its ancestor 'specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement'. The hierarchy chain may already be established through the parent. Review if the direct link to the ancestor is semantically necessary.
