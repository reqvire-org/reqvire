## Auto-fixable Issues

### Redundant Verify Relations

**Verification: Test Verification**
File: [specifications/Verifications/Tests.md#test-verification](specifications/Verifications/Tests.md#test-verification)

Redundant verify relations (these can be automatically removed):
  * verify: [specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement)

Reason: This verification already verifies 'specifications/Requirements.md#leaf-requirement' which derives from 'specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement'. Verification traces automatically roll up through derivedFrom relations, so verifying the leaf requirement is sufficient.
