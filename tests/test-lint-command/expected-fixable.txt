## Auto-fixable Issues

### Safe Redundant Hierarchical Relations

**Element: Single-Chain Redundant Requirement**
File: [specifications/Requirements.md#single-chain-redundant-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#single-chain-redundant-requirement)

Safe redundant derivedFrom relations (these can be automatically removed):
  * derivedFrom: [specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement)

Reason: This element reaches 'specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement' through a single chain via 'specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement'. The direct relation to the ancestor is redundant and safe to remove.

### Redundant Verify Relations

**Verification: API Integration Test**
File: [specifications/Verifications/Tests.md#api-integration-test](specifications/Verifications/Tests.md#api-integration-test)

Redundant verify relations (these can be automatically removed):
  * verify: [specifications/SystemRequirements.md#authorization](specifications/SystemRequirements.md#authorization)

Reason: This verification verifies leaf requirements which derive from parent requirements also directly verified. Verification traces automatically roll up through derivedFrom relations, so verifying the leaf requirements is sufficient.
