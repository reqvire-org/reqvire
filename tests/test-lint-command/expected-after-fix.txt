### Maybe-Redundant Hierarchical Relations

**Element: Maybe Redundant Requirement**
File: [specifications/Requirements.md#maybe-redundant-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#maybe-redundant-requirement)

Potentially redundant derivedFrom relations detected:
  * derivedFrom: [specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement)

Reason: This element has derivedFrom to both 'specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement' and its ancestor 'specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement'. The hierarchy chain may already be established through the parent. Review if the direct link to the ancestor is semantically necessary.
