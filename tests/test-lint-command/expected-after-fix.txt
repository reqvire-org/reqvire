## Needs Manual Review

### Multi-Branch Convergence

**Element: Multi-Path Redundant Requirement**
File: [specifications/Requirements.md#multi-path-redundant-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#multi-path-redundant-requirement)

This element reaches a common ancestor through multiple distinct branch paths:
  * Common ancestor: [specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement](specifications/Requirements.md#root-requirement)
  * Branch paths:
    - Via: specifications/Requirements.md#alternative-parent-requirement
    - Via: specifications/Requirements.md#parent-requirement

Reason: This element reaches the common ancestor through multiple branches. Both branches may be semantically necessary (element derives from ancestor in multiple contexts), OR one branch may represent a modeling error. Human review is required to determine if all branches are valid.

### Multi-Branch Convergence

**Element: API Specification**
File: [specifications/SystemRequirements.md#api-specification](specifications/SystemRequirements.md#api-specification)

This element reaches a common ancestor through multiple distinct branch paths:
  * Common ancestor: [specifications/SystemRequirements.md#authorization](specifications/SystemRequirements.md#authorization)
  * Branch paths:
    - Via: specifications/SystemRequirements.md#management-api
    - Via: specifications/SystemRequirements.md#public-api

Reason: This element reaches the common ancestor through multiple branches. Both branches may be semantically necessary (element derives from ancestor in multiple contexts), OR one branch may represent a modeling error. Human review is required to determine if all branches are valid.
