# Test: HTML Export
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Acceptance Criteria:
# - System should export specifications to HTML format
# - HTML files should be saved in the designated output location
# - HTML output should maintain the structure and content of the original specifications
# - SpecificationIndex.md should be renamed to index.html in output
# - Links in diagrams and text must be converted to use .html instead of .md
# - Paths in HTML files should maintain the original relative structure
# - System should work in environments without Git repositories
#
# Test Criteria:
# - Command exits with success (0) return code
# - HTML files are generated at the expected location with .html extension
# - SpecificationIndex.md is converted to index.html
# - HTML content preserves the structure and information from the source files
# - Links in HTML files use .html extension instead of .md
# - Mermaid click links are properly converted from .md to .html
# - Both GitHub-style URLs and direct file paths in mermaid click links are handled correctly
# - Paths should not have duplicated folder names (e.g., specifications/specifications)
#
