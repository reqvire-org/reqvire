# Test: Diagram Relation Filtering
# ---------------------------------
# Acceptance Criteria:
# - System should render only forward relations to prevent duplicate arrows
# - System should include parent elements in diagrams even when they belong to different sections
# - System should apply direction-based rendering according to relation type registry
# - Generated diagrams should not contain both forward and backward relations for the same logical relationship
#
# Test Criteria:
# - Command exits with success (0) return code
# - Diagrams contain only forward relations (e.g., `contain` but not `containedBy`)
# - Bidirectional relationships appear as single arrows in their forward direction
# - Parent elements are included when child elements are in the section
# - No duplicate arrows exist for the same logical relationship
# - Arrow directions follow the semantic direction defined in relation type registry
