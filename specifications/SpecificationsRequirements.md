### Requirements Change Propagation

When a requirement is changed, the system shall propagate the change through related requirements, verification artifacts, and design elements according to relation type definitions and propagation rules.

#### Details
<details>
<summary>View Full Specification</summary>


## Change Impact Propagation in Requirements

Requirements are interconnected through relations, and changes to a requirement may affect related requirements, verification methods, design specifications, or software components.

Changes propagate based on the relation type, which determines the impact direction and scope.

Changes to high-level requirements cascade down to implementation.
Verification artifacts must be marked for revalidation to reflect changes.
Automated tools should flag all impacted requirements for review.

### Relation Categories for Change Propagation

For change propagation purposes, relations can be categorized into several groups:

1. **Hierarchical Relations** - Changes propagate from parent to child elements (derivedFrom)
2. **Satisfaction Relations** - Changes to requirements affect implementations (satisfiedBy)
3. **Verification Relations** - Changes to requirements invalidate verifications (verifiedBy)
4. **Traceability Relations** - No change propagation, for documentation only (trace)

---


## Change Propagation Mechanism

When a requirement changes, impact analysis must be conducted based on its relations. The following mechanism ensures traceability and controlled updates.

- Identify Impacted Relations
  - When a requirement is modified, check its Relations subsection to identify linked elements.
- Determine Change Propagation Scope
  - Apply the rules in Relation Types and Change Propagation Rules to assess whether the change affects child requirements, design artifacts, verification, or other linked documents.
- Invalidate Affected Elements
  - If a related element is impacted, flag it for review.  
  - Example: If a requirement verified by a test changes, the test must be reviewed.
- Require Re-validation or Re-design
  - If changes affect satisfaction (e.g., code or architecture), update the relevant design.  
  - If changes affect verification, update test cases or validation documents.
- If a change results in a requirement being merged, split, or removed, update its Relations to maintain traceability.

## Examples of Change Propagation


### Parent-Child Requirement Change

```markdown

---

### Parent Requirement
This requirement defines a high-level system constraint.

#### Relations
  * derive: [Child Requirement](#child-requirement)


---

### Child Requirement
This requirement defines additional functionality.

```

If Parent Requirement changes, Child Requirement must be reviewed and updated.


---

### Requirement Satisfied by a Design Specification

```markdown

---

### Functional Requirement

The system shall process transactions within 500ms.

#### Relations
  * satisfiedBy: [architecture/system_design.md/Performance Constraints](architecture/system_design.md#performance-constraints)
```

If Functional Requirement changes, Performance Constraints in the architecture document must be updated.



---

### Requirement Verified by a Test

```

---

### Safety Requirement

The system shall shut down if temperature exceeds 100°C.

#### Relations
  * verifiedBy: [test_cases/safety_verification.md/Overheat Shutdown Test](test_cases/safety_verification.md#overheat-shutdown-test)

```

If Safety Requirement changes, the Overheat Shutdown Test must be reviewed for update and executed again for verification.



---

### Example of Multi-Level Change Propagation in Requirements

The following analysis explains how a **change in the requirement**  propagates through multiple levels of related requirements, impacting their definitions, design artifacts, and verification processes.

---

```
### Root Requirement: System Power Management

The system shall implement power-saving mechanisms to optimize battery usage.  

---

### Power Saving Mode

The system shall activate power-saving mode when the battery level drops below 20%.  

#### Relations
  * deriveFrom: [System Power Management](#system-power-management)
  * satisfiedBy: [software/power_control.md](software/power_control.md)
  * verifiedBy: [test_cases/power_saving.md](test_cases/power_saving.md)

---

### CPU Power Reduction

The system shall reduce CPU frequency by 30% in power-saving mode.  

#### Relations
  * deriveFrom: [Power Saving Mode](#power-saving-mode)
  * satisfiedBy: [firmware/cpu_manager.md](firmware/cpu_manager.md)
  * verifiedBy: [test_cases/cpu_throttling.md](test_cases/cpu_throttling.md)

---

### Screen Brightness Adjustment

The system shall reduce screen brightness by 40% in power-saving mode.  

#### Relations
  * deriveFrom: [Power Saving Mode](#power-saving-mode)
  * verifiedBy: [test_cases/screen_brightness.md](test_cases/screen_brightness.md)

---

### Battery Optimization

The system shall disable non-essential background services when battery levels drop below 15%.  

#### Relations
  * deriveFrom: [System Power Management](#system-power-management)
  * satisfiedBy: [software/battery_manager.md](software/battery_manager.md)
  * verifiedBy: [test_cases/battery_saving.md](test_cases/battery_saving.md)

---

### Network Power Optimization
The system shall reduce network polling frequency when battery levels drop below 15%.  

#### Relations
  * deriveFrom: [Battery Optimization](#battery-optimization)
  * satisfiedBy: [software/network_manager.md](software/network_manager.md)
```

**Power Saving Mode** requirment has been changed to:
>The system shall activate power-saving mode when the battery level drops below 30%.


Change Propagation Flow:
1. A **change** in **Power Saving Mode** flows **downward** to **CPU Power Reduction**.
2. A **change** in **Power Saving Mode** flows **downward** to **Screen Brightness Adjustment**.
3. Additionally, all **satisfiedBy** and **verifiedBy** relations from affected requirements must be reviewed:
   - **Power Saving Mode** → **software/power_control.md** (implementation) & **test_cases/power_saving.md** (verification).  
   - **CPU Power Reduction** → **firmware/cpu_manager.md** (implementation) & **test_cases/cpu_throttling.md** (verification).  
   - **Screen Brightness Adjustment** → **[test_cases/screen_brightness.md** (verification).

### Structure of Markdown Documents

The system shall implement the structure, rules, and usage of **Sections**, **Elements**, **Subsections**, **Relations**, and **Identifiers** in Markdown (`.md`) documents following clearly defined specifications.

#### Details
<details>
<summary>View Full Specification</summary>


## Sections in Markdown Documents

A **Section** is used for grouping of similar requirements for easier management and visualizations. It starts with a `##` header and includes all system elements under that header until the next header of the same or higher hierarchy.

## Elements in Markdown Documents

An **Element** is a uniquely identifiable system element within a Markdown document. It starts with a `###` header and includes all content under that header until the next header of the same or higher hierarchy.

### Structure of an Element

1. **Element Header**
  - The `###` header defines the start of an element.
  - The text of the `###` header serves as the **element name**.
  - The element name must be unique within the same document to ensure unambiguous references.

2. **Element Content**
  - The element includes all content under the `###` header until:
    - The next `###` header, or
    - A higher-level header (`##`, `#`), or
    - The end of the document.
  - The content can include:
    - Text
    - Subheaders (e.g., `####`)
    - Bullet points, code blocks, tables, etc.


## Rules for Elements

1. **Header Format**:
   - An element must start with a 3 `###` header.
   - The `###` header text must not be empty.

2. **Uniqueness**:
   - Element names must be unique within the same file.
 
3. **Nested Subheaders**:
   - Subheaders within an element defined with 4 header (e.g., `####`) are part of the same element and do not create new elements.

4. **No Overlapping Content**:
   - Content in an element belongs exclusively to that element and cannot overlap with another.




### Examples of Elements

Single Element:
```markdown


### My Element

This is the content of My Element.

#### Subsection
Additional details about My Element.
```

Multiple Elements:
```


### Element One

This is the content of Element One.



### Element Two

This is the content of Element Two.
```

Nested Subheaders:
```


### Main Element
This is the main element content.

#### Subsection
Details about the subsection.

#### Another Subsection
More details about another subsection.
```



### Invalid Cases

Element headers empty:
```
###
```

Headers not unique within the same document:
```




### Duplicate
Content of the first duplicate.



### Duplicate
Content of the second duplicate.
```

```

## Subsections in Markdown documents

An element may contain different **Subsections**, some of which are strictly defined, while others allow free-form content.
- **Reserved Subsections**: These subsections follow a predefined structure.
- **Other Subsections**: These allow additional descriptive or supporting information.

Subsections starts with the `#### Subsection Name` and ends either with new element or next subsection.
Subsection must be located **within an element chunk**.

The `#### ` header marks the beginning of the subsection.
It must appear directly within an element chunk, **following** the `###` header of the parent element and any preceding content, including previous subsections.
Each element chunk can have **at most one** `#### SubsectionName` subsection where 'SubsectionName' is a unique name of the subsection within an element.

The reserved subsections are:
 * Relations
 * Details
 * Properties
 * Metadata
 
Those have defines structure that must be followed.


### Details Subsection

Must be defined with a level 4 header: `#### Details`.

When parsing `#### Details` subsections, any markdown headers or elements within <details>...</details> tags are skipped.

The **#### Details** subsection within an element provides additional information directly related to the main requirement text.

- Content within the **Details** subsection is considered an **extension of the requirement text**.
  - It serves the same purpose as refirement relation in other mbse tools and sysml.
- Any statements in the **Details** subsection hold the same validity as the main requirement text.

###  Relations Subsection

Must be defined with a level 4 header: `#### Relations`.

Duplicate relation entries within the same `#### Relations` subsection are not allowed.

### Metadata Subsection

Must be defined with a level 4 header: `#### Metadata`.

The metadata section of an element follows these rules:
1. Contains properties in list format: `* property_name: property_value`
2. Property entries are listed as bullet points (`*`), with **two spaces** (`  *`) of indentation followed by property_name + ': ' + property_value.
3. May include any custom properties, not just `type`

#### Reserved Properties

The following properties have special meaning:

- `type`: Defines the element type
  
- Additional reserved properties may be defined in future releases

#### Supported Element Types

Element types are identified through a reserved "type" metadata property. The following types are supported:
1. **requirement**: System requirment
2. **user-requirement**: User requirement
3. **verification**: For verification tests and validation procedures
4. **test-verification**: For verification tests and validation procedures
5. **analysis-verification**: For verification tests and validation procedures
6. **inspection-verification**: For verification tests and validation procedures
7. **demonstration-verification**: For verification tests and validation procedures
8. **other**: Custom element types defined by users

#### Type Determination

The type of an element is determined through the following process:

1. If a `#### Metadata` subsection exists and includes a `type` property, use that value
2. If no type is specified, default to `user-requirement`, if document is in the root of `specifications` folder, otherwise to `requirement` type.
3. Future versions may add more built-in types as needed

#### Example Metadata Section

```markdown

### My Element

This is a verification element.

#### Metadata
  * type: verification
  * priority: high
  * owner: team-a

#### Relations
* verifies: [Some Requirement](#some-requirement)
```

```markdown

### My Element

This is a verification element.

#### Details

Some details.

#### Metadata
  * type: verification
  * priority: high
  * owner: team-a

#### Relations
  * verifies: [Some Requirement](#some-requirement)
```

#### Verification Type Categories

The following verification types are supported:

1. **Default Verification Type**
   - `verification` - Verification through testing (equivalent to `test-verification`)

2. **Specific Verification Types**
   - `test-verification` - Explicit verification through testing with documented test procedures
   - `analysis-verification` - Verification through formal analysis of documentation or code
   - `inspection-verification` - Verification through formal inspection or review
   - `demonstration-verification` - Verification through demonstration in a realistic environment

The appropriate verification type should be selected based on the nature of the requirement:
- **Test-verification**: Used when formal test procedures with expected outcomes are required
- **Analysis-verification**: Used when requirements can be verified through analysis of documentation or code
- **Inspection-verification**: Used when requirements can be verified through review of artifacts
- **Demonstration-verification**: Used when requirements can be verified by demonstrating functionality

### Identifiers and Relations

The system shall implement  **Identifiers** and **Relations** following clearly defined specifications to ensure consistency, validity, and efficient querying and manipulation of these entities.

#### Details
<details>
<summary>View Full Specification</summary>

## Identifiers in Markdown Documents

An **identifier** consists of a path following a filename with an extension (e.g., `file.md`) and optionally  **element** name (fragment).  

Every **element** in the system has unique identifier that depends on document it appears in, path of the document, and element name (fragment).

## Identifier in markdown document can be of several types

-**Identifier**
  - An internal system element reference with fragment, pointing to specific elements within markdown documents.
  - Used for element-to-element relations (e.g., `derivedFrom`, `verifiedBy`, `verify`)
  - **Example**: `"file.md#element-name"`
- **ExternalUrl**
  - An external URL represented as a string.
  - Used for references to external resources
  - **Example**: `"https://example.com"`
- **InternalPath**
  - An internal filesystem file path without fragment, pointing to implementation files.
  - Used for satisfaction and traceability relations (e.g., `satisfiedBy`, `satisfy`, `trace`)
  - **Example**: `"../core/src/diagrams.rs"`
  
  
### Identifier Path Resolution Rules

- If an identifier **starts with `/`**, it is considered relative to the **git repository root folder**.
- If an identifier **does not start with `/`**, it is considered **relative** to the path of the document in which it appears.

Each **identifier** must uniquely reference either:
  - A **file**, or
  - An **element within a file**.

#### Identifier Path Resolution Examples

Assuming the **<git repository root> folder** is `project` and a file exists at `/path/to/project/documents/File1.md`:

| Identifier | Resolves to | Type  |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| `File2.md` | `project/documents/File2.md` | InternalPath |
| `subfolder/File3.md` | `project/documents/subfolder/File3.md` | InternalPath |
| `../File4.md` | `project/File4.md` | InternalPath |
| `/project/File4.md` | `project/File4.md` | InternalPath |
| `https://example.com` | `https://example.com` | ExternalUrl |
| `../Requirments#element-name` | `project/Requirments#element-name` | Identifier |

---

### Identifier Form Variations and Examples

System recognises 2 kinds of identifier that may appear in documents and relations:
 * Simple identifiers
 * GitHub-style Markdown Link Identifiers


Both Simple identifier and link part of GitHub-style markdown identifier can be etiher internal internal paths or external links (eg. starting with known scheme eg. https://)
 
 
When parsing identifiers, both styles are nomarlized into the same form used internally by the system.

As part of normailization process, element names are converted to **GitHub-style anchor link** fragments which are internal identifer representations:
  - Convert to **lowercase**.
  - Replace **spaces with hyphens (`-`)**.
  - Remove **disallowed characters**.
  - Remove **leading and trailing whitespace**.


#### 1. Simple Identifiers

Plain file or element references, following the path resolution rules.


Examples:

- File only identifier found in the document '<git repository root>/path/to/document.md'
```
file.md
```
  - Normalized to '<git repository root>/path/to/file.md'

- File with an element fragment in the document '<git repository root>/path/to/document.md':  
```
file.md#element name
```
  - Normalized to '<git repository root>/path/to/file.md#element-name'

- Relative path with an element fragment in the document '<git repository root>/path/to/document.md':  
```
../relative_path/file.md#element name
```
  - Normalized to '<git repository root>/path/file.md#element-name'

- Element name fragment only (within the same file) in the document '<git repository root>/path/to/document.md':  
```
#element name
```
  - Normalized to '<git repository root>/path/to/document.md#element-name'
  
  
- Relative path with the element fragment with special characters in the document '<git repository root>/path/to/document.md':
```
path/file.md#My Element (Draft)
```
  - Normalized to '<git repository root>/path/to/path/file.md##my-element-draft'
  

- Absolute path with the element fragment in any document:
```
/path/file.md#Elements
```
  - Normalized to '<git repository root>/path/file.md#elements'
  
       
#### 2. GitHub-style Markdown Link Identifiers

A valid GitHub-style Markdown link to a file or a fragment within a file.
Identifier is considered the **link** part of the markdown link: everything inside '(identifier)'.

Once link part is obtained from GitHub-style Markdown link, it is following same rules for normalization as **simple identifiers**. 
   
Examples:

- File link in '<git repository root>/path/to/document.md':  
```
[Specification](documents/specification.md)
```
  - Normalized to '<git repository root>/path/to/path/documents/specification.md'

- Fragment link in '<git repository root>/path/to/document.md':  :  
```
[My Element](documents/specification.md#my-element)
```
  - Normalized to '<git repository root>/path/to/path/documents/specification.md#my-element'

##  Relations in Markdown Documents

The `#### Relations` subsection specifies associations between elements, files, or other resources, forming the logical and dependency structure of the model.  

The `#### Relations` subsection:
- Is a dedicated part of an **element** section in Markdown document.
- Starts with the `#### Relations` header.
- Contains a list of relations in a specific format.


The `#### Relations` subsection must be located within an element chunk.
Each element chunk can have at most one `#### Relations` subsection.

The `#### Relations` header marks the beginning of the subsection.

The `#### Relations` subsection must appear directly within an element  chunk.
It must follow the `###` header of the parent element and any preceding content.


### Relation Structure

- Relation entries are listed as bullet points (`*`), with **two spaces** (`  *`) of indentation.

####  **Relation Format**
   - Relations follow this format:
     ```
     * relationType: **identifier**
     ```
   - Example:
     ```
     * dependsOn: [Element2](#element2)
     ```

####  **Relation Type**
   - Specifies the type of the relationship.
   - Allowed characters: `[a-zA-Z]`
   - Minimum length: **2 characters**  
   - Maximum length: **80 characters**  
   - Must be one of the predefined, case-sensitive types


####  **Target Identifier**
   - Specifies the target of the relation.
   - Must be a valid **Simple Identifier** or **Git Valid Markdown Link Identifier** as defined in this document.



---

### Examples of `#### Relations`

#### 1. **Simple Relations**
```markdown


### My Element
This is the content of My Element.

#### Relations
  * dependsOn: [Element2](#element2)
  * relatedTo: [path/to/anotherFile.md/Section3](path/to/anotherFile.html#section3)
  * uses: [file.md](file.html)
```

#### 2. **Relations with Special Characters**
```markdown


### API v2.0
Details about API version 2.0.

#### Relations
  * satisfies: [documents/specification.md#API: v2.0](documents/specification.html#api-v20)

```

#### 3. **Relation to an Element in the Same File**
If the referenced element exists within the same file, the identifier can be a fragment only.

```markdown

#### Relations
  * extends: [Another Section](#another-section)
```

#### 4. **Relative Path Relations**
If the referenced file is located in a subfolder relative to the current document, use a relative path.
```markdown

#### Relations
  * derive: [subfolder/details.md#refined-section](subfolder/details.html#refined-section)

```

#### 5. **Absolute Path Relations**

If the reference starts with /, it points to a file or element relative to the git repository root folder.

```markdown

#### Relations
  * verifiedBy: [/specifications.md#verification-steps](/specifications.html#verification-steps)

```

#### 6. **Invalid Relations Example**

```markdown

This element contains invalid relation entries.

#### Relations
  * derivedFrom: [Element2](#element2)
* InvalidEntry
* : MissingRelationType
  * trace: [path/to/file.md](path/to/file.html)
```

## Identifier Usage in Relations

Identifiers are used in relations to reference files or specific elements within files. Examples:

1. **Relation to a File**:
   ```markdown
   #### Relations
     * satisfiedBy: [documents/specification.md](documents/specification.html)
   ```
    
2. **Relation to an Element**:
   ```markdown
   #### Relations
     * derivedFrom: [documents/specification.md/section one](documents/specification.html#section-one)
   ```
   

## Validation rules

The system must validate relation usage according to these rules:
- Only the relation types defined in this registry are allowed
- Relations should connect elements of appropriate types
- Circular dependencies should be detected and reported
- Duplicate relation entries of same type and target are not allowed
- **Identifier** targets (with fragments) must reference existing elements in markdown documents
- **InternalPath** targets (without fragments) must reference existing files in the filesystem
- **ExternalUrl** targets are not validated for existence

### Relation Types and behaviors

The system shall implement relations following clearly defined specifications for types and behaviors.

#### Details
<details>
<summary>View Full Specification</summary>


## Relation Type Definition

A relation type in Reqvire:
- Defines a semantic connection between elements
- Specifies the directionality of the relationship
- Determines change propagation behavior
- May have an opposite/inverse relation type

## Core Concepts

### Relation Usage Categories

Relations are categorized by their usage in different system functions:

1. **Diagram Rendering** - Relations that are rendered in visual diagrams to avoid duplicate arrows
   - Only one relation from each opposite pair is shown (e.g., `derive` but not `derivedFrom`)
   - Those are: `derive`, `satisfiedBy`, `verifiedBy`, `trace`

2. **Change Propagation** - Relations through which changes propagate to dependent elements
   - When an element changes, impact flows through these relation types
   - Those are: `derive`, `satisfiedBy`, `verifiedBy`

3. **Verification traces**: Relations through which propagation from the verification element to requirements in traced (verification roll-up)
   - Trace which requirements verification verifies: directly or indirecty  
     - Parents inherit status from children via «derive» (e.g., ALL children verified => parent Verified).  
   - Those are: `derivedFrom`

## Comprehensive Relation Type Table

| Relation Type | Opposite Type | Diagram Rendering | Change Propagation | Description |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **derivedFrom** | derive | No | No | Links a child element to the parent element it is derived from |
| **derive** | derivedFrom | Yes | Yes | Links a parent element to child elements derived from it |
| **satisfiedBy** | satisfy | Yes | Yes | Links a requirement to elements that satisfy it |
| **satisfy** | satisfiedBy | No | No | Links an implementation to the requirement it satisfies |
| **verifiedBy** | verify | Yes | Yes | Links a requirement to verification artifacts |
| **verify** | verifiedBy | No | No | Links a verification artifact to the requirement it verifies |
| **trace** | None | Yes | No | Establishes a trace relationship without change propagation |

## Relation Categories

Relations are grouped into logical categories based on their semantic meaning:

### 1. Hierarchical/Transitive Relations

These relations define hierarchical structures and transitive ancestry within the model:
- **derivedFrom/derive**: Derivation of elements from higher-level elements

### 2. Satisfaction Relations

These relations connect requirements to implementations:

- **satisfiedBy/satisfy**: Links requirements to design, code, or architectural elements

### 3. Verification Relations

These relations connect requirements to verification elements:

- **verifiedBy/verify**: Links requirements to tests, validations, or other verification artifacts

### 4. Traceability Relations

These relations establish lightweight connections for documentation:

- **trace**: Simple non-directional traceability without strong semantic meaning or change propagation

## Change Impact Rules

When an element changes, the impact propagates according to these rules:

1. **Hierarchical Changes**:
   - Changes to parent elements propagate to all children
   - This includes derivation relationships

2. **Requirement Changes**:
   - Changes to requirements propagate to all satisfying implementations
   - Changes to requirements invalidate all verifications

3. **Implementation Changes**:
   - Changes to implementations rarely propagate upward to requirements
   - Implementations should be updated to maintain satisfaction

4. **Verification Changes**:
   - Changes to verification artifacts generally don't propagate
   - Verification updates may be needed after requirement changes

5. **Trace Relationships**:
   - Changes do not propagate through trace relationships
   - Trace relationships are used for documentation and discovery purposes only
