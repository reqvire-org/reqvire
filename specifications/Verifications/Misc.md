# Miscellaneous Verifications

This document contains miscellaneous verification tests that don't fit into the other verification categories.

## Export and Context Verifications

- index.html shall serve as the primary entry point for HTML documentation
- Links in diagrams and text must be converted to use .html instead of .md
- Paths in HTML files should maintain the original relative structure
- System should work in environments without Git repositories

##### Test Criteria:
- Command exits with success (0) return code
- HTML files are generated at the expected location with .html extension
- Output directory contains index.html file
- index.html contains links to all specification documents
- index.html structure follows expected format
- HTML content preserves the structure and information from the source files
- Links in HTML files use .html extension instead of .md

### CLI Help Structure Verification

This test verifies that the CLI help output displays all commands and their options flattened in the main help, and that all CLI command requirements are covered.

#### Details

##### Acceptance Criteria
- Running `reqvire` (without arguments) displays the main help output as the default command
- Main help output shows Usage line: `reqvire [OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [COMMAND OPTIONS]`
- Main help lists all available commands under "Commands:" section
- Main help lists all global options under "Options:" section
- Command-specific options are displayed under dedicated headings (e.g., "SUMMARY OPTIONS:", "FORMAT OPTIONS:")
- All command options are flattened and visible in the main help without needing to drill down
- Help output includes nested subcommands expanded (e.g., "matrix", "traces", "coverage")
- Each command's help text is descriptive and clear

##### Test Criteria
1. **Main help output structure**
   Command: `reqvire`
   - exits code **0**

   - output contains "Commands:" section
   - output contains "Options:" section with `-c, --config`, `-h, --help`, `-V, --version`

2. **Command listing completeness**
   - All CLI commands are listed: html, format, validate, generate-diagrams, remove-diagrams, summary, section-summary, change-impact, verifications
   - Nested commands are expanded: "matrix", "traces", "coverage"

3. **Options flattening - all command-specific option sections present**
   - FORMAT OPTIONS section visible
   - SUMMARY OPTIONS section visible
   - SECTION-SUMMARY OPTIONS section visible
   - CHANGE IMPACT OPTIONS section visible
   - VERIFICATIONS MATRIX OPTIONS section visible
   - VERIFICATIONS TRACES OPTIONS section visible
   - VERIFICATIONS COVERAGE OPTIONS section visible

4. **Help text quality**
   - Each command has descriptive help text
   - Options have clear descriptions

### Format Command Requirements Verification

This test verifies the format command requirements from SystemRequirements and UserRequirements, focusing on normalizing and standardizing MBSE models for consistency and readability.

#### Details

##### Acceptance Criteria
**Format Command Functionality:**
- System shall provide format command that normalizes and standardizes markdown documents
- System shall support --dry-run flag to preview changes without applying them
- System shall display changes in git diff style with line numbers and colors
- System shall show diff output when applying formatting changes (not only in dry-run mode)
- System shall support --json flag for structured output of formatting results
- System shall preserve all document content while improving formatting consistency

**Content Preservation:**
- System shall preserve personas sections and other non-element content
- System shall maintain element ordering within sections
- System shall preserve section ordering throughout documents
- System shall preserve page content (frontmatter before first section)
- System shall preserve section content (content between section headers and first element)

**Formatting Consistency:**
- System shall trim excess whitespace from lines
- System shall normalize line endings consistently
- System shall insert proper separators between elements
- System shall normalize consecutive separators to single separators
- System shall normalize relation indentation to proper 2-space format
- System shall format relation links with human-readable names
- System shall clean up file references to show filename only for implementation files

**Document Structure Normalization:**
- System shall add level 1 page header (based on filename) when document lacks page header
- System shall add `## Requirements` section header when elements exist without section header
- System shall preserve existing page headers (starting with `# `)
- System shall preserve existing section headers (starting with `## `)
- System shall correctly distinguish level 1 headers from level 2+ headers

**Change Preview Quality:**
- System shall show file identification clearly in change output
- System shall display line references with consistent width based on maximum line number

**Known Limitations:**
- Diff output may not correctly display blank line additions in all cases (blank lines shown with ‚ê§ character may have incorrect line numbering or positioning)
- System shall visualize trailing whitespace removal with special characters
- System shall use colors to distinguish additions (green) and removals (red)
- System shall group changes by file with clear separators
- System shall only show lines that have changes, omitting unchanged content
- System shall provide context lines before and after changes for better readability
- System shall maintain sequential line numbering that reflects final file positions
- System shall ensure line number continuity throughout diff output

- System shall convert simple identifiers (non-markdown format) to proper markdown link format
- System shall convert absolute links to relative links where appropriate
- System shall preserve already correct relative links without modification
