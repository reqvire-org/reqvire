## Explanation of Reqvire Use Case Diagram

This diagram outlines the core interactions, components, and workflows of the **Reqvire** tool in the context of managing Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) models, integrating with external systems, and supporting development activities for a System of Interest (SOI).


### Reqvire Tool

The central component of the system, which facilitates various MBSE-related activities. It consists of two primary submodules:

#### Cli (Command Line Interface)
- Manage MBSE Model: Core functionality to handle the MBSE model lifecycle.
- Generate Diagrams: Allows users to generate visual representations of the system model.
 - Diagrams can be generated for different viewpoints.
- Analyze Relations: Provides tools to analyze relationships and dependencies within the model.
- Provide Reports: Generates structured reports based on the model and analysis.
- Validate Structure: Ensures the model adheres to defined structure and guidelines:
  - Markdown Structure: Verifies the correctness of the Markdown-based requirements and documentation.
  - Filesystem Structure: Validates the file organization in the project.
- Generate Traceability Matrix: Produces matrices to link requirements to related elements.
- Trace Changes
  - Tracks changes and display/visualize affected elements based on relations.
  - Tracks elements such as verifications, that may require invalidation based on detected changes. 
  - This ensures that all affected components are flagged for review or updates.

### System of Interest (SOI)

The **System of Interest (SOI)** refers to the system which is under development.
 
It represents the primary focus of development and includes the following key elements:
- MBSE Model: The structured system specification and design documentation created and managed using Reqvire. 
  - This model defines the requirements, architecture, and traceability necessary for developing the SOI.
- Developed System: The actual physical or implemented system that is built based on the MBSE model. 
  - It embodies the realization of the design and requirements outlined in the model.
- Git Repository: A storage and version control system where the MBSE model and the developed system artifacts are stored.
  - This repository can be organized as a monorepo or a multirepo, depending on the project’s needs.

The SOI serves as the centerpiece of the Reqvire framework, linking specifications, development, and validation processes.



### External Systems

Reqvire interacts with external systems to enhance functionality and support development workflows.

### CI/CD System

Reqvire provides tools and features that CI/CD systems, such as GitHub Actions, can utilize to perform tasks like validation, diagram generation, and traceability matrix creation. 

These tools enable CI/CD systems to enforce PR merge rules, validate changes, and automate feedback processes, such as adding comments, creating issues, or reporting statuses. 

### GitHub or Similar

Reqvire integrates into existing agile and collaborative workflows by providing the necessary tools and scripts to support version control, change management, and traceability. 
These features allow teams to seamlessly integrate MBSE practices into their development processes, enabling effective collaboration through GitHub or similar platforms.

### Human Interaction

Humans interact with Reqvire tools to manage, refine, and validate MBSE models, as well as to collaborate effectively within development workflows:
- Via CLI: Users leverage Reqvire’s CLI to perform tasks such as managing models, generating diagrams, analyzing relationships, and validating structures.
- Via AI Agents: Users interact with AI agents to receive intelligent suggestions, review potential improvements, and approve changes, ensuring a human-in-the-loop approach.
- Collaboration: Users integrate Reqvire into agile workflows by collaborating through GitHub or similar platforms to manage repositories, track changes, and maintain traceability.


## Workflows and Interactions


### Reqvire Interactions with Git

- Reqvire uses Git repositories to store and version the MBSE model and developed system.
- Changes, including approved AI suggestions, are prepared and committed through standard Git workflows.


### CI/CD Integration
- CI/CD pipelines trigger validation, diagram generation, and traceability processes.
- Invalid merges are prevented based on the validation results.

### SOI Feedback Loop
- The Developed System provides feedback to the MBSE Model, enabling iterative refinement.
- The model guides the development of the system, ensuring alignment with requirements and objectives.


## Key Relationships

- The MBSE Model is implemented into the Developed System, which is stored and versioned in the Git repository.
- The Reqvire CLI provides tools to validate, analyze, and generate artifacts from the model.
- AI Agents assist humans by generating suggestions and automating repetitive tasks.
- The **CI/CD System** ensures quality control and prevents invalid changes from being merged.
